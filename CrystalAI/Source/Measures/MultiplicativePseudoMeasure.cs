    /// Calculates a multiplicative pseudo-measure, namely, this class calculates the product
    /// of <see cref="P:Crystal.Utility.Combined"/> in <see cref="T:System.Collections.ICollection"/>.
    /// 
    /// Note that this pseudo-measure, in this or similar forms, is used utility AIs by game developers. 
    /// From a mathematical point of view the use of this pseudo-measure simply doesn’t make sense. That, 
    /// in and of itself, doesn’t 
    /// mean that this pseudo-measure shouldn’t be used or that it is somehow inherently a bad practice. 
    /// However, due to the fact that this pseudo-measure multiplies the elements of the vector of 
    /// utilities, it exhibits some peculiar behaviour for vectors of different length. For example, 
    /// ignoring the weight in utilities for the time being, let’s say that you have a vector of 
    /// utilities that is (0.9, 0.9) and another that belongs to a different option that is 
    /// (0.92, 0.92, 0.92). Using the MultiplicativePseudoMeasure on these two vectors will result in 
    /// a final value for the first equal to 0.81 and 0.77 for the second. This means that the first 
    /// option will be selected ignoring the fact that each of its considerations individually have 
    /// lower utility compared with the second option. This is counter intuitive, and because of this, 
    /// <strong>I would avoid using this pseudo-measure</strong>. Nevertheless, it appears to be in common use so 
    /// an implementation is available for completeness. If you have insights on the reasons behind 
    /// the use of this particular pseudo-measure in the game development industry I would love to hear them!
